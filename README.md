>This is a sample Java web project that shows how Aspose APIs can assist in document creation, formatting, processing and conversion in different formats like Excel, Word, PDF. This project creates reports in Excel, PDF, HTML and PNG formats against some selected criteria.

You can download evaluation APIs from following URLs:

## Project Configration:

This is a Java web project that can easily be imported on Eclipse, however there will be slight modifications on Net-beans or IntelliJ IDEA. I have included all the dependencies/libraries in the lib folder which can be added into class-path.

Database dump in included with the project as a employees.rar file.

Tomcat 6 has been used an application server, however project can be run on other application servers like JBoss or Glass-fish.

ANT build script is also provided so that project can be build independently.

## Project Usage:

When the application is run it shows four options as radio button group i.e.

* Search All Employees.
* Search All Departments.
* Search By Employee.
* Search By Department.

When search by employee or by department is checked a combo box with employees or departments is shown which can be selected.

User have to select file format type in the combo box.

After the search criteria is submitted, a download link will display from where a report can be downloaded in required format.


Thanks
