File-Format-Management
======================

This is sample project to show how Apose API's can help in document processing/conversion in difference file formats. This application shows reports against different queries and display the reports in Exce, PDF, HTML and PNG formats. 

For this sample project I have used Aspose Cell component API for JAVA. For programmers guide you can visit following link.

CONFIGURATION:

This is a web project and you can easily import it on Eclipse however there will be slight modifications on Netbeans or InteliJ IDE's. I have included all the dependencies in the lib folder you can add these into you classpath.

I have used Tomcat 6 as a application server, however project can be run on other application servers like JBoss or GlassFish.

If you are developer you can deploy the project in IDE as a exploded type however if you want to use build script I have provided ANT build script for that purpose. Build process will create a war file in dist folder that you can later deploy.

I have also included unit tests for the project and created a ANT target for the unit tests as well.


Thanks
